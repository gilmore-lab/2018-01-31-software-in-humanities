# What is Databrary?

---

<img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/web/images/logo/databrary-nav.svg" height=300px/>

### databrary.org

## A data library

### Specialized for storing, sharing, browsing, and reusing video & audio

### Store and share session (person + place + time) metadata

## Policy framework for securely sharing identifiable data

### Videos are identifiable

---

## Restrict access: To researchers formally authorized by their institutions

### Access agreement signed by researcher, institution

## Store for research team use; preservation

## Share with other researchers only with permission

# How does it work?

## Register for access

### Databrary staff get in touch
### Institution signs [Databrary Access Agreement](https://www.databrary.org/resources/agreement.html)

## Browsing

### Log on
### Search, filter, play
### Most teaching & pre-research use cases do not require IRB approval

## Sharing data

### Upload as-as-you go ("self-curate")
### Add metadata, links to other resources
### Give collaborators access
### Share when you're ready (paper goes to press, grant ends)

## Secondary (re)use

### Get IRB approval
### Search, filter
### Download
### Code & use videos

# Strengths & weaknesses

## Strengths

### Large-scale secure cloud storage
### Open sharing with restricted community of researchers
### Consistent permission framework

## Weaknesses

### Doesn't just "sync"" with cloud storage (e.g. Box, Dropbox, etc.)
### Manual entry of metadata
### New (~4 years old), only 20% of data are shared; limited scope

# Use cases

## Teaching

# The future

## Domains beyond developmental psychology

## From data repository to analysis platform

## Machine-assisted audio & video analysis

## Video as research documentation
